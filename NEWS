Changes from 0.0000007 to 0.0000008.

	* inclusion of Foole's managed port of StormLib.  The
          unmanaged version is still included, but is no longer built
          by default.  Additionally, to use the unmanaged version even
          after building it, you have to enable a configuration
          option.  Look at scsharp.exe.config for more details.

	* The ready room code is now in.  Barring glitches in audio
          playback which seem legion, the mission briefings should
          proceed as normal, including establishing shots.

	* Text rendering is now (more or less) anti-aliased and
          pretty.

	* The code handles the distinction between "broodwar is
          installed" and "user selected broodwars" better now.

	* lots of misc fixes.
