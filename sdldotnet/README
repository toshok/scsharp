Project Name: SDL.NET
Project Description: SDL.NET is a set of object-oriented .NET bindings for the SDL gaming library (http://libsdl.org) - a cross-platform multimedia library designed to provide level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, 3D hardware via OpenGL, and 2D video framebuffer.

Current maintainer: David Hudson (jendave@yahoo.com)

Assembly:
	Name: SdlDotNet.dll
	Namespace: SdlDotNet
	Notes:
		There is one assembly. 
		Tao.Sdl (http://www.mono-project.com/Tao) contains 
		the low-level bindings to the seven C libraries (SDL, SDL_image, SDL_ttf, SDL_mixer, SDL_gfx, smpeg, SDL_net)

Zip file contains:
	/* - info files, Strong name keys, build/solution files.
	/bin - Assemblies
	/doc - HTML, CHM and tutorial docs.
	/lib - library dependencies. Please put these libs in your path.
	/examples - demo apps for the library
	/extras - Extra libraries based on SDL.NET
	/src - source
	/scripts - build scripts
	/tools - utils
	/tests - unit tests
	
		
Development Environment:
	Runtimes/Compilers:
		.NET SDK 1.1 SP1.
		.NET SDK 2.0 SP1.
		Mono 1.1.13.2
		
	IDEs:
		Visual Studio 2003
		SharpDevelop
		VIM
		
	Tools:
		NAnt 0.85 2006-12-13 nightly build
		Nunit 2.2.6
		dnpb 1.3.0
		NSIS
		
		Notes: NAnt will be the primary way to create release builds.

	Dependencies (make sure these are in your path):
		C libraries
		SDL 1.2.9
		SDL_image 1.2.4
		SDL_mixer 1.2.5
		SDL_ttf 2.0.7
		SPMEG 0.4.4
		SDL_gfx 2.0.13
		
		.NET libraries
		Tao.Sdl

		Notes: Randy Ridge of the Tao project and I worked on the native C 
		bindings for the SDL libraries and Randy
		added them to Tao. This gives the bindings and broader user base so
		additional work can be done on the bindings.
		SDL.NET will focus on the higher-level features.

Approach:
	The API is modeled somewhat after pygame. Since pygame is a successful object-oriented wrapper around SDL, 
	it makes sense to look to pygame for inspiration. Obviously there will be areas 
	where they will differ. 

Coding Style
	Follow .NET naming conventions. **DONE**
	CLS compliance **Done**

Demos
	To start read the install file and install SdlDotNet.dll and Tao.Sdl.dll.
	The best examples to start with are probably the Rectangles. It show the basics of how the Video, Surface and Event classes works.
	The BounceSprites Example show basic animation.
	The BombRun, SnowDemo show some more animation.
	The Gears demo shows how SDL.NET works with OpenGL.
	The MoviePlayer plays a short MPEG-1 file.
	The CDPlayer uses the CDRom subsystem and show how SDL.NET can use WinForms.
	The AudioExample shows how the music and sound system work.
	The SimpleGame is more interesting from a code standpoint because it is strict Model-View-Controller design pattern. It is based on a Pygame tutorial.
	The SpriteGuiDemo shows several sprite examples and uses a simple GUI.
	The Triad example is a full Tetris-like game.
	The ParticleSExample show a fireworks type display that uses the SdldotNet.Particles engine.
	The NeHe and RedBook examples show how to use OpenGL with SDL.NET.
