Things you need to do to make this work:

1) You need mono version 1.1.14 or newer.

2) Make your "Program Files\Starcraft" directory available on your
   linux box.  Either copy it or mount your windows volume.

3) Do the same with the "install.exe" file from the Broodwars CD.
   This release requires that file be present.  It can live on the CD,
   or you can copy it to the local filesystem.  It must be the Broodwars
   CD at the moment, due to the fact that the font code only works
   with the files on the BW cd for some reason.

4) Edit the starcraft.exe.config file and point it at the directories
   from 1) and 2).

5) Make sure you have the following SDL packages installed (these
   versions should work, as well as newer ones.):

	SDL-1.2.9        (http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php)
	SDL_mixer-1.2.6  (http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/release/)
	SDL_image-1.2.4  (http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/release/)

7) That's it.  The following should be enough:

	$ mono starcraft.exe
